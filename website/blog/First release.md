Welcome to the first release of _Roadmap to Janna_. I hope it will be as beneficial for you as it has been for me, or even more.

Iâ€™ll aim to release an update at the beginning of each month or less frequently, depending on changes to the system.

Each update will include three sections:

- What was added
- What changed
- What was removed
