* Link to [Sincerity and Truthfulness](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Sincerity%20and%20truthfulness.md):
    * **In worship**, do not seek worldly gains from acts of worship or mix them with pure intentions. Only the purely intended part of the deed is rewarded, while evil intentions annul the good deed.
    * **In normal acts:** Have the right intention to gain rewards. Permissible acts, such as eating, sleeping, or other routine tasks, can be elevated to acts of worship with the correct intentions.
* Link to [Patience](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Patience.md): One form of patience involves renewing and purifying intentions before engaging in worship.
* Link to [Reliance](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Reliance.md): Begin actions by saying _Basmala_ (In the name of Allah), acknowledging that Allah enables you to perform these deeds.
* Link to [Gluttony and Lust](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Gluttony%20and%20lust.md): Practice contentment and gratitude by saying _Basmala_ before eating, recognizing these blessings, and being satisfied with a small amount of food.
* Link to [fasting](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/fasting.md): Make an intention (_niyyah_) the day before fasting. You can set reminders in an app to help establish this habit.

Here are some occasions when you should say “basmalla”:

* When waking up
* Before eating and drinking
* Before wudu and salah
* When leaving the house
* Starting any work or task
* When opening or closing doors
* Before sleeping
* Before engaging in a discussion

:::tip summary

Perform actions with pure intentions, seeking Allah's blessings, by making basmalla before major actions.
