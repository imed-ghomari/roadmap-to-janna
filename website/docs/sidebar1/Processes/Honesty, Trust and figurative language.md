* Link to [Loquaciousness](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Loquaciousness.md): Avoid disclosing secrets, breaking promises, and lying (except for reconciliation, war, or protecting others). Avoid backbiting (with some exceptions), cheating, slander, and hypocrisy.
* Link to [Sincerity and truthfulness](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Sincerity%20and%20truthfulness.md):
    * To the people: Be honest with others and avoid using figurative language unless necessary. Be mindful of your words when making supplications. If you are trading, disclose any product defects.
    * To God: Be sincere with God by not lying, betraying Him, or breaking promises. Avoid hypocrisy by not meaning what you say when reciting adkar and by abstaining from sinning when alone.
* Link to [Upholding the rights of Muslims](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Upholding%20the%20right%20of%20muslims.md): Respect Muslims' right to confidentiality, fulfill promises made to them and safeguard their property, even in their absence.
