* Link to [Fear and hope](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good-traits/Fear%20and%20hope.md): Ensure consistency in actions, avoid wishful thinking, and link hope to concrete actionable steps.
* Link to [Love of status and ostentation](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad-traits/Love%20of%20status%20and%20ostentation.md): You are consistent in doing good. You don't stop when other people stop, and you don't stop if others discourage you or attack you. You are not doing it for them; you are doing it for the sake of God.
* Link to [Self scrutiny](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good-traits/Self%20scrutiny.md):
	* Evaluate the sincerity of the worship acts, and if you didn't do some of them, overload yourself with nawafil, recitation, and adkar.
	* If you can't do a process related to a bad trait, punish yourself by fasting or giving to charity.

:::tip summary
