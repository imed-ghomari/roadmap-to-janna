Acknowledge your good qualities, accomplishments, and progress, but always attribute them to the One who bestowed them upon you. Think of it like a king granting access to a treasuryâ€”the key is yours, but the riches belong to him.

Regarding **progress** specifically, recognize what you have accomplished, as this doesn't contradict humility. Just make sure to thank Allah for his guidance.
