* Like to [praying](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/praying.md): Whenever the need arises (rain, eclipse, funeral), or the time is right (taraweeh, eid), try your best to go to these voluntary prayers.
* Link to [Upholding the right of Muslims](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/upholding%20the%20right%20of%20muslims.md): It's a Muslim right to join the funeral prayer of a deceased Muslim. (If enough people join, the obligation is removed from other people.)
