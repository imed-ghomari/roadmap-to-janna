* Link to [Repentance](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good-traits/Repentance.md):
	* **About the past**: Regret the sin you did and ask for forgiveness within 6 hours of sinning by saying dua outside or inside prayer (in nafl repentance prayer)
	* **About the future**: Plan for future prevention, commit to never doing it again, do good deeds for every bad deed you did to balance the scale and ask forgiveness if it affected others
* Link to [Praying](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Praying.md): Perform Nafl repentance prayers (2 rakat) anytime, even after Asr, or integrate the intention into other Nafl prayers, like the 12 daily Sunnah prayers.
* Link to [Remembering Death](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good-traits/Remembering%20death.md): Ask forgiveness and work on reconciliation to ensure smooth passage through the bridge of Qantara, avoiding delays or reduced rank in Paradise.
* Link to [Fear and Hope](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good-traits/Fear%20and%20hope.md): Maintain hope in Allah's forgiveness to avoid despair and inaction after sinning.

## ### When to Say _Astaghfirullah_

1. **After Salah:** Recite the _Master of Forgiveness Dua_ to address any deficiencies in prayer.
2. **Repentance:** Seek forgiveness after committing a sin or entertaining sinful thoughts.
3. **At the End of Gatherings:** Recite: _Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika, Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Anta, Astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk_. This helps remove sins from the gathering.
4. **After Praise:** Reflect on your shortcomings and seek forgiveness to remain humble.
5. **To Relieve Stress:** Reciting _Astaghfirullah_ can help reduce stress and anxiety.
