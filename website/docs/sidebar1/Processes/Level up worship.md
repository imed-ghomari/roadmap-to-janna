It would be best if you waited for the current worship processes to mature somewhat before attempting to improve them to avoid losing progress by doing too much too soon.

**Actions to Enhance Worship:**

* Increase Tahajjud prayer time.
* Attend Masjid more frequently until all prayers are performed there.
* Read more Quran.
* Fill more free time with supplications.
* Donate more.
* Fast at the third level of focus when feasible.
* Fast more, such as on designated bid days or observing Siyam Dawud.
* Reach out to others more.
* Avoid questionable permissible activities.
