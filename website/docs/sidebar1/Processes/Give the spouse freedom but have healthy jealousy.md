* Link to [Envy](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad-traits/Envy.md): Good envy or jealousy is to be jealous over your spouse
* Link to [Managing spouse](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Managing%20spouse.md), in regards to women, give her freedom in:
    1. Her money (spend as she likes)
    2. She can have a job given that she takes care of her side of the obligations
    3. Observing moderation in jealousy (not being unmindful of the first steps of a destructive end but not going overboard with suspicion either)
