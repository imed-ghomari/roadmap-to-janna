* **[Repentance](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Repentance.md):** This is a critical step of repentance to be taken when you're about to commit a sin or during a sin. It focuses on the present moment and involves:
    * **Stopping the sin** and any associated negative thinking by recognizing the nature of the action and the consequences associated with it.
    * **Hating the sin, not yourself.** Shift focus away from self-criticism and use affirming, encouraging language. Have a growth mindsetâ€”believe in your ability to overcome shortcomings and return to the right path.
* **[Gluttony and Lust](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Gluttony%20and%20lust.md):** When facing desires, counter them with the "two destroyers of pleasures":
	* The recitation of the Quran by reading fear-inducing verses or verses that talk about the specific consequence of such sins
	* The remembrance of death by visualizing your own or other peoples' death through the means available to you.

:::tip Summary  

Engage in repentance by stopping the sin out of fear, hate the act (not yourself), and have a growth mindset.
