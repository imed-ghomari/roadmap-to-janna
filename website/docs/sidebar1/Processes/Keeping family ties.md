	* Who? It can stop at uncles and aunt from the mother and the father, though you can extend it as you see fit.
	* What to do? Ask about their news, be aware of their situation by calling or meeting, and try to give them your time.
	* Exception? This should be done **especially** if they don't treat you well or severed contact with you.
* Link to [Remembering death](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md): Protecting this specific amana (family ties) will help you get back up when you're about to fall from the Sirat!
