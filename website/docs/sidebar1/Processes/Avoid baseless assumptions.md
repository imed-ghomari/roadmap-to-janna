* Link to [upholding the right of muslims](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/upholding%20the%20right%20of%20muslims.md):
	* Unless you have clear proof that the other person is wrong, keep trying to find excuses for them.
	* Don't put yourself in suspicious situations.
* Link to [managing spouse](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/managing%20spouse.md): **beautify** your spouse in your mind by not thinking negatively about them and by speaking well of them in front of others. (related to the Quran verse about spouses being like garments, which we wear to beautify ourselves)

> The exception to this is when assuming something based on evidence, to protect yourself against wrongdoing and investigating to ensure you're dealing with trustworthy people.
