* Link to [Seeking the lawful](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Seeking%20the%20lawful.md): can be applied to music.. etc. Only seek when absolutely necessary, and leave them whenever you can.
* Link to [Reliance](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good-traits/Reliance.md): make sure to stop at the lawful means, even if the unlawful ones seem more reliable at getting results.
