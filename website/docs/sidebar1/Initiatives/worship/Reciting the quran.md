The Prophet said, "The best among you are those who learn and teach the Quran." He also mentioned, "On the Day of Judgment, it will be said to the people of the Quran, 'Read and ascend in ranks. [Recite](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Recite%20the%20quran.md) as you used to in the world, for your position will be at the last verse you recite.'" Therefore, [learning and reviewing the Quran](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Learn%20and%20review%20the%20quran.md) throughout our lives is important. Additionally, the Quran serves as a source of [healing](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Use%20quran%20for%20healing.md).

## Outer Manners

1. **Respectful Posture**: Recite the Quran with reverence. Sit still, bow your head, maintain ritual purity, and face the direction of prayer. Avoid reclining, sitting cross-legged, or other casual postures as you would in front of a Quran teacher. Articulate each letter clearly, apply tajweed rules, and beautify your voice as best you can.
2. **Yearning for Virtue**: Seek to reach the highest virtues in reciting, such as reciting during prayer, especially while standing, in the mosque, and [at night](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Pray%20tahajud%20prayer.md).
3. **Frequency of Recitation**: Aim for one of three levels: completing the Quran once a month, once every three days, or once weekly. If this is difficult, recite a manageable portion daily, and consider completing it during tahajud prayers if you're busy.

## Inner Secrets

1. **Reverence for Divine Speech**: As you begin, feel the words' greatness by acknowledging the Speaker's greatness.
2. **Contemplation of Meanings**: Reflect on the meanings of the verses. Let the Quran's messages guide your understanding of Allah's attributes and actions.
3. **Gaining Insight**: In your reflection, glean deeper realizations from the Quran. For each subject—such as Allah's attributes, guidance to the Straight Path, the prophets, or destruction of enemies—appreciate Allah's qualities like Mercy, Might, Kindness, and Justice. View each category with the depth it merits.
4. **Removing Barriers to Understanding**: Clear away two main barriers: (1) the veil of doubt and worldly desires, and (2) distractions from overanalyzing or being overly literal. True understanding requires moving beyond the surface to grasp the inner core of the Quran's messages.
5. **Acquiring States and Effects**: Beyond simply reading, embody the verses' qualities. When reading about mercy and forgiveness, feel joy; at mentions of wrath, feel awe; when Allah's names are mentioned, bow in humility. Adapt your response according to the message in each verse.

## Levels of Recitation

1. **Conscious Recitation**: Be mindful of the one you are reading.
2. **Personal Connection**: Feel like the Quran speaks directly to you.
3. **Awe and Wonder**: Approach the Quran and its Creator with awe, exploring each word's depth and beauty.
