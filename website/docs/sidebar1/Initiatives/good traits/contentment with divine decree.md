## The Sign of Love is Contentment During Tribulation

Some deny that contentment is possible in situations that conflict with personal desire, believing patience is the only option. This perspective often stems from rejecting love, whereas we affirm that love is real. A true sign of love is [contentment during hardships](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Combat%20ostentation%20during%20worship.md) and acceptance of situations that conflict with one's desires. Contentment can be understood in three ways:

1. **Wonder Overwhelming Pain**: Deep love can fill a person with such awe that they hardly feel any pain, as seen even in worldly love, where desire or anger can become overwhelming.
2. **Acceptance with Faith**: A person may feel pain and naturally dislike it but still accept it due to the knowledge of the immense reward that comes from enduring hardship. Just as a sick person tolerates the discomfort of painful treatment, knowing it leads to healing, one who believes the reward of tribulation outweighs the pain can find contentment in it.
3. **Trust in Divine Wisdom**: Belief in Allah's wisdom behind all things removes any sense of objection or doubt. Rather than questioning or feeling confused by events, a person accepts them, trusting Allah's knowledge over their own and understanding that everything unfolds as intended.

## Combining Contentment with Allah's Decree and [Dislike for Disbelief and Disobedience](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Hate%20the%20disobedient%20and%20love%20the%20obedient.md)

Allah commands believers to dislike those who oppose His command. To love Allah means to fulfill this duty. Imagine a beloved saying, "Prove your love by treating my servant harshly until he rebels against me. If you hate him, you show love for me; if you love him, you oppose me." In this way, you can dislike the servant's action if it shows enmity toward your beloved, even if your beloved intended for him to act that way. Thus, you hate his opposition as a sign of your loyalty, yet accept it as part of Allah's greater plan.

## The Meaning of Contentment with Allah's Decree

Contentment with Allah's decree means pursuing what pleases Him by [following the means](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Supplicate%20for%20what%20you%20wish%20and%20aim%20high.md) He has provided for this purpose. It involves refraining from anything that would oppose Allah's pleasure and instead striving to connect oneself with His beloved servants by keeping His commands and avoiding His prohibitions.
