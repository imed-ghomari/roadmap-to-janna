The goal of this project was to focus on a certain type of excluded or unnoticed gap in the knowledge most people have that results in the a lack of implementation of known practices. As a result the project is divided into three part:

- the first part is to understand the science around goal setting, habit formation and behavior change
- the second part is to get a sense of all the practical implications of the abstract concept we know of
- the third part is to show you can begin taking action.

## The First part - the System

For goal setting, the system uses the OKR method which comprises of 3 components (the objective - the key result and the initiatives). To put it simply the only difference between how people set goals and this method is the introduction of key results which are the outcome of the actions (here called initiatives) that we think will reach the objective. so each actions is a hypothesis that may or may not reach the objective. This probability rests on the relevance of the outcome (here called key result) to the objective. Keep this in mind you'll see it again when we talk about the actions further down.

Now, let's focus on the initiatives. Put simply, they are the high level actionable items needed to done to reach our objective, here being janna. First we need to document the initiative and prepare what is needed, this is achieved through projects. Then after the preparation, different processes or habits are created and implemented. Once done, we can say that we are actively performing said initiatives.

The processes or habit are implemented/changed/improved/swapped using the tiny habits model, B = MAP, it will be detailed in [process handling](sidebar1/Setting%20up/process%20handling.md). And these processes belong to multiple initiative at the same time, this is done because of the nature of the objective and because of the principle number 2.

To recap, here is a outline of what we talked about for a better visual representation:

```md
- Ojbective
	- Key result 1
		- Initiative 1
			- Project
			- Process 1
				- Tiny habit model
			- process 2
				- ...
		- Initiative 2
			- ...
	- Key result 2
		- ...
```

The last important part of the system is the review, any actions that needs to be done repeatedly long term, needs to be reviewed. Here we need to review the processes periodically to make sure the initiatives are being performed to make sure the key result are accomplished to reach the ultimate goal.

## The Second part - what Todo

### Contextualisation of the OKR Method

Of course the goal is: to get into the highest level in paradise without any type of reckoning or punishement. of if it isn't then it should be per the hadith.

This goal is achieved through 3 key result (per the revival of religious sciences) and their respective initiatives:

- outer actions - worshipping allah
	- [praying](sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/praying.md)
	- [zakat and charity and selflessness](sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/zakat%20and%20charity%20and%20selflessness.md)

	- [remembering death](sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/remembering%20death.md)
	- [self scrutiny](sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/self%20scrutiny.md)

### The Principles

The initiatives/processes follow a set a principles:

- **Simple but inclusive**: to cater to all type of muslim without loosing the important point needed to understand the nuances of the action. different audiences might befenit:
	- new muslim to get overview of what needs to be done
	- veteran muslim to perfect current practice
	- muslim scholar to use better his personal methodology
- **Only practical knowledge** which means leaving out faith building exercices given their abstract nature. Consequently, this project's goal is not to do da3wa, though if it has that effect it is welcomed (some books from the revival were excluded because of this). if theoratical knowledge to ground your faith is what you seek --> see current link
- **Built for easy review**: to make it easier to maintain over a long period of time, it is imperative to merge similar concepts under the same actions and keep the number of items to review to a minimum

> notice about tawakul and that this is not a surefire way of getting to janna, we only did our best to help the most we could, but hidaya and evelation will always remain in allah's head, subhanah

### Sources and Inspirations

I didn't include the sources next to each actions in the processes, because of the complexity of the endeavour, however I tried to use trusted sources as much as possible. The project was heavily inspired from the revival of religious sciences by imam abu hamid al'ghazali and was scrutinized by a handful of other books and resources, like:

- A Handbook of Spiritual Medicine by Ibn Daud
- manhaj al-muslim volume 1 by abu bakr jabir al-jaza
- handbook to god podcast by yaqeen institute and other yaqeen content
- reflecting on the names of god by jinan yousef
- productivity principles of umar 2 by ismail kamdar
- â€¦

## Third part - Taking Action

### How to Use

1. You can either use your own system by extracting the processes documented here
2. Or you can use the tool endorsed by the author with the file associated with it and follow the tutorial. as bonus you'll get a dynamic visual representation of your performance and a gamification of the system to keep you going. for more detail on how to achieve that see [Obsidian implementation](sidebar1/Setting%20up/Obsidian%20implementation.md)

### How to Contribute

You are encouraged to create a PR, if not then an issue in github. And only contact me if you want to review the entirety of the project.

Make sure to always cite your reason for any change and the reference of said change, i'll of course prioritize a scholar's opinion over a layman, and i'll prioritize someone who wants to get involved in the entirety of the project over someone who wants to change a small part of it. i'll try to get to your request in weekly or monthly basis based on my availability.
