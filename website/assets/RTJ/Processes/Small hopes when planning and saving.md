* Link to [Remembering death](Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md): Maintain short-term hopes by planning only the immediate morning or evening, and remember death twice a day on these occasions
* Link to [Reliance](Initiatives/good%20traits/Reliance.md): Be wary of over-planning and over-saving; they might lead you to believe that you can influence the outcome. Focus on acquiring absent benefits or repelling harm that has a high probability of success.
