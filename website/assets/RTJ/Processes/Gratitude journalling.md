## Example of Gratitude Journaling

To enhance your gratitude journaling, it's important to distinguish between **short-term blessings** and **long-term blessings**. **Short-term blessings** are fleeting and can disappear quickly, while **long-term blessings**, like good health or a stable job, are more enduring and can last for weeks or months. This exercise focuses on short-term blessings to keep your reflections fresh and avoid repetition.

### Steps

1. **Write daily blessings**:  
   At the end of each day, or the start of the next, write one blessing from the previous day in each of the following categories:  
	* **Spiritual blessings**: E.g., a moment of peace during prayer, a recent act of charity, or a brief but meaningful connection with someone in need.
	* **Material blessings**: E.g., a delicious meal, finding a parking spot when you were in a hurry, a moment of rest after a busy day, or a small gift someone gave you.
	* **Immaterial blessings**: E.g., feeling safe in your surroundings, having a moment of calm or the opportunity to learn something new.
2. **Visualize gratitude**:  
   Reflect on and visualize people who lack the blessings you listed. This helps cultivate gratitude by following the Prophet's advice to compare yourself to those less fortunate.  
3. **Keep your blessings visible and unique**: Write all daily blessings on the same page for the week, ensuring that each day's blessing is new and not repeated from the other days. This keeps your reflections fresh and helps you recognize different aspects of your life. Refresh the page only at the start of the following week.
4. *(Optional)* **Aggregate blessings and review**:  
   Save your weekly entries so you can compile them monthly or yearly, creating a broader perspective of your blessings over time. With this knowledge, you can identify patterns and areas you take for granted.
