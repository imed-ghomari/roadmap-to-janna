**When Being Praised**

* Recite the specific dua "Allahumma la tu'akhithni bima yaqulunâ€¦" when being praised.
* If the praise is based on knowledge and piety, thank Allah and find joy in the existence of these attributes.
* If the praise is based on wealth or status (illusory), stop the person or leave the conversation.

**When Praising Others**

* Avoid praising the attributes of others unless they recognize the true bestower of those attributes (Allah).
* Only praise others if it will benefit their realization of this truth.
