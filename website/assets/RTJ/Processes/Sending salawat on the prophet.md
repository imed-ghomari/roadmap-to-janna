Being grateful for the prophet by saying salawat. Here are the multiple occasions where you should send salawat:

* When the prophet is mentioned (at least the first time, which is obligatory)
* In morning and evening supplications
* If you are applying the order in the dua (begin and end)
* During the night and day of jumu3a
