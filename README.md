This project aims to focus on a certain type of excluded or unnoticed gap in religious knowledge that results in a lack of implementation of known practices. As a result, the project is divided into three parts/steps:

- The first step is understanding the science around goal setting, habit formation, and behavior change.
- The second step is getting a sense of all the practical implications of the abstract concepts we know of.
- The third step is showing you how you can begin taking action.
