## Good and Bad Envy

Envy—wanting another person's blessing to be taken away or for harm to come to them—is unlawful. However, competition—feeling happy for another's blessings, not wishing them harm, but desiring similar blessings for yourself—is allowed. It is also acceptable to want a blessing removed from someone using it for oppression, as the focus is on ending harm rather than the blessing itself. The proof of this intention is that if the person stopped the wrongdoing, you would no longer wish their blessing to be removed.

You can channel positive envy by motivating yourself to identify your faults and overcome laziness. This can be achieved by [choosing good mentors](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Choose%20your%20mentors%20and%20remember%20them.md). A healthy form of jealousy is also appropriate in [spouse relationships](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Give%20the%20spouse%20freedom%20but%20have%20healthy%20jealousy.md).

Causes of envy include pride, hostility, or selfishness, which resist seeing Allah's blessings on others. This can lead to depression.

## How to Treat Envy and Remove It from the Heart

Envy is a serious heart ailment; knowledge and practice are needed to heal it.

* Knowledge-based treatment involves understanding that envy harms the envier more than the one envied. It nullifies the envier's good deeds, incurs Allah's displeasure, and reflects dissatisfaction with His wisdom. The blessing won't vanish due to envy, and in fact, it increases the good deeds of the envied by transferring the envier's good deeds to them. You should [avoid watching others' blessings](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Avoid%20watching%20other%20people%20blessing%20and%20bless%20them.md) or bless them sincerely to prevent envy.
* Practicing the opposite of envy involves respecting the envied person, celebrating their blessings, and humbling oneself. This approach fosters friendship, reduces envy, and alleviates envy-related pain and sin. If controlling envy proves difficult, protect yourself from sin with these two actions:
	1. Avoid displaying envy in speech, actions, or gestures, and instead [pray for the well-being of others](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Supplicate%20for%20other%20people%20alive%20or%20dead.md).
	2. Dislike your ego's desire for Allah's blessings to be removed from anyone. A true sign of this dislike is resisting any opportunity to harm their blessings, even if the ego wishes it. Additionally, if given the chance to help maintain or increase that person's blessings, do so—even if you find it challenging.
