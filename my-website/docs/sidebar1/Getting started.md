This project aims to focus on a certain type of excluded or unnoticed gap in religious knowledge that results in a lack of implementation of known practices. As a result, the project is divided into three parts/steps:

* The first step is understanding the science around goal setting, habit formation, and behavior change.
* The second step is getting a sense of all the practical implications of the abstract concepts we know of.
* The third step is showing you how you can begin taking action.

## The First Part - The Basics of the System

The system uses a **Reverse Goal Setting** method, which consists of three main layers: **Vision**, **Objectives**, and **Domains**.

* **Vision**: This is the ultimate destination or the highest aspiration (e.g., Janna).
* **Objectives**: These are the major milestones or areas of focus required to realize the vision.
* **Domains**: These are specific areas of responsibility or influence where actionable work happens.

Each **Domain** includes documentation that links to multiple **processes** or habit files detailing the necessary actions. When all the processes related to a domain are implemented, the domain is considered well-managed.

The **processes or habits** are implemented, changed, improved, or swapped using a specific framework explained further in [Process handling](docs/sidebar1/Resources/Process%20handling.md). Due to the interconnected nature of the objectives, processes can be part of multiple domains simultaneously. Each process file includes a link to the relevant domains to facilitate navigation.

For a clearer understanding, here is an outline of the system:

```md
- Vision
	- Objective 1
		- Domain 1
			- Process 1
				- Process handling
			- Process 2
			- ...
		- Domain 2
		- ...
	- Objective 2
	- ...
```

The final, crucial part of the system is the **review process**. Any action that needs to be sustained long-term should be reviewed periodically. This ensures that the processes are being carried out effectively and that domains remain on track to achieve the objectives and the ultimate vision.

## The Second Part - What To Do

### Contextualization

The **Vision** is to attain the highest level in paradise without any reckoning or punishment. According to the prophet, If this isn't the goal, it should be.

This Vision is achieved through 3 Objectives and their respective Domains: (some domains are grouped due to their similarity in theme)

* Objective: Outer actions - Worshiping Allah
	* [Praying](docs/sidebar1/Objective/worship/Praying.md)
	* [Zakat, charity, and selflessness](docs/sidebar1/Objective/worship/Zakat%20and%20charity%20and%20selflessness.md)
	* [Fasting](docs/sidebar1/Objective/worship/Fasting.md)

	* [Gluttony and lust](docs/sidebar1/Objective/bad%20traits/Gluttony%20and%20lust.md)
	* [Loquaciousness](docs/sidebar1/Objective/bad%20traits/Loquaciousness.md)
	* [Anger](docs/sidebar1/Objective/bad%20traits/Anger.md)
	* [Envy](docs/sidebar1/Objective/bad%20traits/Envy.md)
	* [Stinginess](docs/sidebar1/Objective/bad%20traits/Stinginess.md)
	* [Love of status and ostentation](docs/sidebar1/Objective/bad%20traits/Love%20of%20status%20and%20ostentation.md)
	* [Pride, self-admiration, and humility](docs/sidebar1/Objective/bad%20traits/Pride%20and%20self%20admiration%20and%20humility.md)
* Objective: Inner actions - Developing praiseworthy character traits
	* [Repentance](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Repentance.md)
	* [Fear and hope](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Fear%20and%20hope.md)
	* [Asceticism](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Asceticism.md)
	* [Patience](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Patience.md)
	* [Gratitude](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Gratitude.md)
	* [Sincerity and truthfulness](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Sincerity%20and%20truthfulness.md)
	* [Reliance](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Reliance.md)
	* [Love and contentment](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Love%20and%20contentment.md)
	* [Remembering death](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md)
	* [Self-scrutiny](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Self%20scrutiny.md)

> To make the domains more comprehensive, I merged the domains of the bad traits with their opposite good traits, as one represents the absence of the other.

### The Principles

The domains/processes follow a set of principles:

1. **Simple yet Comprehensive**: Designed to cater to all types of Muslims while retaining the key points needed to understand the nuances of each action. This benefits different audiences, including:
    * **New Muslims**: Providing an overview of essential practices.
    * **Practicing Muslims**: Helping perfect their current practices.
    * **Muslim Scholars**: Enhancing personal methodologies.
2. **Practical Knowledge Only**: Focused exclusively on actionable knowledge, excluding abstract or faith-building exercises (some books from the *Revival* were excluded because of this). While the project is not intended to be a da'wah, any positive da'wah effect is welcome. For those seeking theoretical knowledge to ground their faith, seek other resources.
3. **Built for Easy Review**: Merged similar concepts under unified processes to minimize their number. This ensures easier reviews and supports long-term maintenance.

You might encounter some actions in the domain that don't have any process linked to them. This can be explained by one of three reasons:

* The action demands a project, not a process.
* The action has already been included in another process.
* The action is too simple or too vague to be included in a process that is due for monthly review.

### Sources and Inspirations

I didn't include the sources next to each action in the processes because of the complexity of the task; however, I tried to use trusted sources as much as possible. The project was heavily inspired by *The Revival of the Religious Sciences* by Imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali and was supplemented through other books and resources, such as:

* *Handbook to God* playlist by Yaqeen Institute and other Yaqeen content
* *The Way of the Muslim* by Abu Bakr Jabir al-Jaza'iri
* *Ranks of the Divine Seekers* by ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya
* *A Handbook of Spiritual Medicine* by Ibn Daud
* *Reflecting on the Names of God* by Jinan Yousef
* …

## Third Part - Taking Action

### How to Use

The system can be implemented using two methods. The first method is simpler to execute but requires a longer review process. The second method is more challenging to implement but benefits from a more streamlined review process.

1. Conduct a [weekly review](docs/sidebar1/Resources/Weekly%20review.md) once you are familiar with the domains and their associated processes.
2. Use the tool endorsed by the author and the associated file by following [this tutorial](docs/sidebar1/Resources/Obsidian%20implementation.md). As a bonus, you'll get a dynamic visual representation of your performance and a gamification of the system to keep you motivated. You can see an example below:

### Limits and Considerations

* In some processes, I have specifically not defined the lower-level actions to be more inclusive. As a result, you will need to identify and include those actions yourself to make the process actionable.
* The review process can be subjective unless you involve other people. While this can help reduce bias, it will not eliminate it entirely.
* The processes are not fully gender, age, or condition-agnostic. If you are a woman, young, elderly, or have a specific condition, you will likely need to tweak or remove certain elements.

### How to Contribute

You are encouraged to create a PR or, if not, an issue on GitHub. Only contact me directly if you wish to review the entirety of the project.

Always cite your reason for any change and the reference for said change. I will prioritize a scholar's opinion over a layperson's; the bigger the change, the more arguments you'll have to provide. I will address your request weekly or monthly, depending on my availability.

Otherwise, you can remember us in your dua, asking Allah to guide and support us in our efforts to make this project beneficial and successful for everyone involved (us included insha'Allah).

:::warning reminder about tawakkul

This is not a guaranteed way of attaining paradise; it is only our best effort to help as much as possible. Guidance and success remain in Allah's hands, subhanahu wa ta'ala.
