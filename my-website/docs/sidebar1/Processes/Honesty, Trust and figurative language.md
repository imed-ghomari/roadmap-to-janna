* Link to [Loquaciousness](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Loquaciousness.md): Avoid disclosing secrets, breaking promises, and lying (except for reconciliation, war, or protecting others). Avoid backbiting (with some exceptions), cheating, slander, and hypocrisy.
* Link to [Sincerity and truthfulness](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Sincerity%20and%20truthfulness.md):
	* To the people: Be honest with others and avoid using figurative language unless necessary. Be mindful of your words when making supplications. If you are trading, disclose any product defects.
	* To God: Be sincere with God by not lying, betraying Him, or breaking promises. Avoid hypocrisy by not meaning what you say when reciting adkar, by abstaining from sinning when alone or voluntarily going against his command while considering yourself a practicing Muslim.
* Link to [Upholding the rights of Muslims](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Upholding%20the%20right%20of%20muslims.md): Respect Muslims' right to confidentiality, fulfill promises made to them and safeguard their property, even in their absence.
* Link to [Remembering death](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md): Fulfilling your responsibilities (general amana) in life will help you get back up on the sirat.
* Link to [Managing spouse](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Managing%20spouse.md):
	* Avoid hypocrisy by treating your family better than outsiders. Show love and attention in private. Treat your children and spouse with respect behind closed doors.
	* Be discreet with information. Categorize facts as secret, neutral, or public information and act accordingly (see table below).

| Fact Type | Secret       | Neutral     | Public    |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| Positive  | Confidential | Shareable   | Shareable |
| Neutral   | Confidential | Depends     | Shareable |
| Negative  | Confidential | Unshareable | Shareable |
