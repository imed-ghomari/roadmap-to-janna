* Link to [Loquaciousness](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Loquaciousness.md): Only speak for Allah's sake, following the principles of commanding good and forbidding evil.
* Link to [Commanding good and forbidding evil](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Commanding%20good%20and%20forbidding%20evil.md):
	* Follow this order:
		* First, explain the offensive nature of the act.
		* Second, admonish the person politely in a gentle manner (motivation).
		* Third, harshly reprimand him.
		* Fourth, forcibly stop the wrong.
		* Fifth, threaten or hit the person to stop the offense.
	* Only address clearly forbidden/obligatory acts that you are knowledgeable about.
	* Stop at the second level for rulers and the fourth level for the spouse and family members.
	* Encourage good behavior through da'wah, even by sharing a single verse of the Quran.
* Link to [Managing spouse](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Managing%20spouse.md):
	* For the wife specifically, discipline her if she's rebellious through the first four levels. Then don't bed her, then be rough (but not in the face and don't leave a mark), then diplomacy through another person, then divorce.
	* Do not taunt or bring up the past when your spouse becomes obedient.
	* Ensure they understand their own religious obligations.
* Link to [Parenting](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Parenting.md): play (0-7), discipline (7-14), befriend (14+)
	* When your child deliberately misbehaves, talk to him privately without labeling him (focus on the actions), by following the levels and use consequences instead of punishments (ex. spilling means cleaning)
	* If the misbehavior is religious in nature, encourage them to seek forgiveness from Allah.

:::tip summary
