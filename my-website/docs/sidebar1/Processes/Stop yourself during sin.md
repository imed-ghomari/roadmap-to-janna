Linked to **[Repentance](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Repentance.md):**

This is a critical step of repentance to be taken when you're about to commit a sin or during a sin. It focuses on the present moment and involves:

* **Stopping** sin and any associated negative thinking by recognizing the nature of the action and its consequences by reciting the associated verses and reflecting on the nearness of death.
* **Hating** the sin, not yourself. Shift focus away from self-criticism and use affirming, encouraging language. Have a growth mindsetâ€”believe in your ability to overcome shortcomings and return to the right path.
