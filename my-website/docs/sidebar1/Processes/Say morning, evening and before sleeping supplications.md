* Link to [Repentance](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Repentance.md): When saying *Astaghfirullah*, repent for outward sins, blameworthy inner traits, occasions of doubt, and heedlessness that leads to forgetting remembrance or delaying progress from one spiritual station to another.
* Link to [Remembrance of Allah](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Remembrance%20of%20allah.md): Engage in supplications from the Sunnah (e.g., morning du'a after Fajr, evening du'a after Asr, and before sleeping after Isha). Additionally, recite *Surah Al-Mulk* in the morning and in the evening and *Surah As-Sajdah* before sleeping.
* Link to [Remembering Death](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md): Reflect on death each time you make these adhkar. This practice helps prevent false hopes and procrastination in repentance.
* Link to [Gratitude](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Gratitude.md): Express gratitude through words by thanking Allah (*Alhamdulillah*) while thinking about His blessings and recognizing that all good comes from Him, not from ourselves.
* Link to [Love and contentment](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Love%20and%20contentment.md): When declaring Allah's perfection by saying *Tasbih*, renew your love for Him.
