* Link to [Pride and self admiration and humility](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Pride%20and%20self%20admiration%20and%20humility.md): Detach your self-worth from temporary worldly blessings, and don't compare yourself to others, thinking you deserve their blessings. This can be exemplified by not oversharing your good traits or accomplishments.
* Link to [Love of status and ostentation](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Love%20of%20status%20and%20ostentation.md): Don't mistake having high status with god as possessing worldly possessions; this status is determined by your closeness to god.
