* Actively work to resolve disputes, whether your own or others'. Mediate and intercede to foster reconciliation.
* Avoid prolonged boycotting; do not let it exceed three days.
* Be vigilant about potential fitna (a trial that, if failed, leads to misguidance). If the situation escalates beyond resolution, prioritize withdrawing and distancing yourself from it.
