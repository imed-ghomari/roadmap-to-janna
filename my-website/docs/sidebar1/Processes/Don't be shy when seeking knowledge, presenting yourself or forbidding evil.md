* Do not be shy when seeking knowledge: Ask questions and do what is necessary to acquire knowledge.
* Do not be shy when presenting yourself for work: Publicize accomplishments with good intentions.
* Do not be shy when forbidding evil and enjoining good: Do not stay silent if you can speak up when things are wrong. Be shy from Allah, not from the creation.
* Do not be shy when telling the truth.
