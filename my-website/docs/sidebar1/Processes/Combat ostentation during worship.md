* Ward off Riya during the act when someone sees you by thinking that what they think doesn't matter; Allah matters. They are like animals or children; they don't benefit you in any way.
* Make sure not to stop the act, keep at it like you intended from the beginning.
* Make sure that if you increase in worship, it's only due to the removal of distractions and motivation of others, but test yourself to make sure.
