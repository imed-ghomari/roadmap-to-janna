* Link to [Engaging with the quran](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Engaging%20with%20the%20quran.md): Read at least 10 ayat so you won't be written with the headless.
* Link to [Praying](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/worship/Praying.md):
	* You can pray it right after isha, or you can wake up before fajr time to pray it, but if you do the latter, make sure not to pray "witr" after isha, because you're not allowed to pray any voluntary prayer after this one.
	* Pray preferably 13 rakat including shaf' and witr (2x6+1).
	* You can pray for half the night, a third of the night, or whatever you can spare before Fajr time.
	* Praying is a form of seclusion (you're alone time with the creator), especially in this prayer, presuming other people are asleep.

> To make it easier to wake up and sleep early (around isha time), use a prayer times application with the notification set a period before Fajr. And finally, place the phone away from you to force yourself to get yourself out of bed. One last tip is to create a special athan: modify the athan to give you at least 1 minute of silence after the first "takbirat" to give you time to reach the phone without rushing.
