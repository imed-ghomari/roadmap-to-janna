* Link to [Upholding the right of muslims](docs/sidebar1/Objective/worship/Upholding%20the%20right%20of%20muslims.md): Unless you have clear proof that the other person is wrong, keep trying to find excuses for them.
* Link to [Managing spouse](docs/sidebar1/Objective/worship/Managing%20spouse.md): **beautify** your spouse in your mind by not thinking negatively about them and by speaking well of them in front of others. (related to the Quran verse about spouses being like garments, which we wear to beautify ourselves)
* Link to [Sincerity and truthfulness](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Sincerity%20and%20truthfulness.md): To avoid misconceptions, refrain from placing yourself in questionable situations. Ensure that your external behavior accurately reflects your internal truth without any deceit, hypocrisy, or pretense.

> The exception to this is when assuming something based on evidence, to protect yourself against wrongdoing and investigating to ensure you're dealing with trustworthy people.
