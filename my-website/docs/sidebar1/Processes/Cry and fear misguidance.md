* [Fear and Hope](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Fear%20and%20hope.md):
	* **For the sinner:**
		* Before committing a sin, avoid having hope of forgiveness. Instead, cultivate fear of punishment to prevent falling into sin. Reflect on the unseen consequences of sins by reading related verses and ahadith.
		* Remember the link between good and bad deeds and how each one will work against the other on the scales.
	* **For the obedient:** Strive to find a balance between fear and hope. Achieve this by considering the verses from the Quran about both the obedient and the disobedient as applying to you.
* [Remembering Death](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md): Be like the person who remembers God in private, leading their eyes to flow with tears, to be among those under God's shade on the Day of Qiyama.
