* Link to [Seeking the lawful](docs/sidebar1/Objective/worship/Seeking%20the%20lawful.md):
	* Learn about the prohibited matters (especially the major sins) and avoid them completely.
	* For doubtful or debated matters with different opinions, like music, leave them whenever possible.
* Link to [Reliance](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Reliance.md): make sure to stop at the lawful means, even if the unlawful ones seem more reliable at getting results.
