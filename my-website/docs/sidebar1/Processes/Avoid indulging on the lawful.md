---

* Link to [Seeking the lawful](docs/sidebar1/Objective/worship/Seeking%20the%20lawful.md): To avoid sin, relinquish lawful actions (like excessive indulgence) that could lead to unlawful ones. This protective measure keeps you distant from sin by reducing the possibility of falling into it.
* Link to [Love and contentment](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Love%20and%20contentment.md): Remove other forms of love and attachment displayed mostly in indulgence because only God's love is enduring, while all others will eventually leave you.
* Link to [Asceticism](docs/sidebar1/Objective/good%20traits/Asceticism.md): Practice moderation in all permissible matters. Use resources beneficially and avoid materialism. Remember that you are a traveler. Examples of asceticism include:
	* General: Abstaining from excessive sleep, food, sex, or distractions like TV or social media.
	* Material Goods: Avoiding unnecessary purchases, managing food portions, and conserving resources like water.
	* Specific: Limit device use to essential tasks and avoid platforms with harmful suggestions.

:::tip summary

Give up lawful indulgences that may lead to unlawful ones; Remove other loves and attachments, as they compete with the love of God and can lead to sin.
