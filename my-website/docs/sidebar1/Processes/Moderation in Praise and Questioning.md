	- **When Being Praised**
		* Recite the specific dua "Allahumma la tu'akhithni bima yaqulunâ€¦" when being praised.
		* If the praise is based on knowledge and piety, thank Allah and find joy in the existence of these attributes.
		* If the praise is based on wealth or status (illusory), stop the person or leave the conversation.
	- **When Praising Others**
		* Avoid praising the attributes of others unless they recognize the true bestower of those attributes (Allah); as such, it won't increase the person's self-admiration and pride.
		* Only praise others if it will benefit their realization of this truth.
		* Avoid exaggeration, insincere affection, speculative statements, and pleasing a wrongdoer.
