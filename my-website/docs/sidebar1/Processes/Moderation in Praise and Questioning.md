Link to [Loquaciousness](docs/sidebar1/Initiatives/bad%20traits/Loquaciousness.md):

* Avoid carelessness in speaking about religion and excessive questioning about Allah's attributes out of doubt.
* If you know that the praise won't increase the person's self-admiration and pride, then you can praise him to encourage him, but make sure to avoid exaggeration, insincere affection, speculative statements, and pleasing a wrongdoer.
