# Caution

The levels of pious caution (warʿ) are four:

1. **The First Level—Caution of the Just**: This initial level involves [adhering strictly to what is prohibited or unlawful](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Disregard%20prohibited%20and%20doubtful%20matters.md) according to legal rulings (fatawa). The focus is on avoiding any clear prohibitions.
2. **The Second Level—Caution of the Righteous**: This level includes [avoiding anything dubious](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Disregard%20prohibited%20and%20doubtful%20matters.md), even if not explicitly forbidden. Dubious matters are those that are neither clearly lawful nor clearly unlawful. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) advised, "Leave what makes you doubtful for what does not make you doubtful."
3. **The Third Level—Caution of the God-Fearing (Al-Muttaqūn)**: Here, the individual [avoids some lawful things](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Avoid%20indulging%20on%20the%20lawful.md) out of fear they might lead to the unlawful. This level involves a higher degree of self-restraint.
4. **The Fourth Level—Caution of the Truthful Ones (As-Ṣiddīqūn)**: This final degree is marked by avoiding anything that does not serve or relate to Allah, focusing entirely on what pleases Him.

# Navigating Uncertainty

* Be prudent when encountering doubtful matters and [investigate suspicious matters](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Investigate%20suspicious%20matters.md) by asking people of knowledge. Be cautious of [the source of wealth](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Make%20your%20earning%20lawful.md), particularly when dealing with individuals known for oppression or engaging in unlawful activities. However don't question individuals who do not bear any signs of wrongdoing.
* In addition to all of this, it is obligatory for a person to ask his heart even if he has been given a ruling. If he finds any disturbance in his heart, then he should avoid it, for sin is the disturbance of the heart and the friction of the chest.
* It is also important to consider the impact on others' hearts. [Don't reject gifts](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Accept%20gift%20if%20lawful%20and%20pure%20intentions.md) or invitations simply because you are uncertain about their permissibility, particularly if doing so could cause offense or hurt feelings. Indeed, gladdening a Muslim's heart and protecting it from offense is more important than caution.
