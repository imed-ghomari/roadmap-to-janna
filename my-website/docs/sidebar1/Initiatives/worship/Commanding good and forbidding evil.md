## Guidelines for Responding to Evil

* When someone witnesses wrongdoing and stays silent, they are complicit in that behavior. However, they shouldn't actively search out others' sins but instead [respect others' privacy](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Don't%20spy%20and%20protect%20privacy.md).
* Even if a person is God-fearing, associating too closely with others can lead to an increase in their own sins. This risk can only be avoided by focusing solely on admonishing and correcting misbehavior without fearing criticism. Additionally, we are encouraged to promote good behaviors by guiding and supporting others.
* The obligation to promote good and prevent evil is removed only when:
	1. There is a genuine fear of physical harm, property damage, or severe harm to one's reputation. It's best to remain composed and avoid confrontation. However, fear of social rejection, gossip, or potential missed opportunities are not valid reasons for avoiding this duty.
	2. If it's clear that advising will be ignored or met with ridicule, a gentle verbal reminder is still encouraged.

## Qualities Essential for Guiding Others

Offering [Advice and admonishment](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Advice%20and%20admonishment.md) should be grounded in these two qualities:

* **Gentleness and Kindness**: When a person forbids evil and is insulted in return, a lack of good character may cause them to react with anger for personal reasons rather than for the sake of Allah. Instead, they should hope for the change of others, even if that change does not come through their own efforts, and [feel pity for the transgressor, supplicating for them](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Hate%20the%20disobedient%20and%20love%20the%20obedient.md). Seeking personal credit for admonishment can be a sign of pride or ego.
* **Self-discipline**: The person advising others should also correct their own behaviour and strive to avoid actions they themselves forbid.

> Keep in mind that concealment and private admonishment should always come first. However, reporting the behaviour to the authorities may become necessary when harm is likely to affect others. When in doubt, advice should be sought regarding the appropriate behaviour to adopt.

## What to Advise About

Here are some examples of behaviors to address, either by offering advice or by discouraging these actions in line with the system's objectives:

* Failing to control one's speech in a meaningful manner.
* Overindulging in food or eating excessively.
* Reacting with anger in situations where patience or calm is more appropriate.
* Exhibiting stinginess or reluctance to spend, particularly when generosity is warranted.
* Overindulging in permissible activities to an excessive degree.
* Allowing sadness, worry, or complaining to dominate due to a lack of contentment or patience.
* Demonstrating insufficient effort or relying passively on fate (false reliance).
* Not adhering to prayer guidelines, such as praying in the mosque or in a congregation when possible.
* Neglecting to follow the Prophet's habits, especially in public or when one's actions may affect others.
* Failing to perform _adhkar_ (remembrances) at prescribed times.
* Seeking earnings through unethical or unlawful means, such as dishonest practices in trade.
* Disrespecting individuals by not treating them in a way that acknowledges their roles or positions.
* Neglecting to advise or correct others when capable and appropriate.
