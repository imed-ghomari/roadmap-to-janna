# Keys to Good Parenting

## [Compassion and Love](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Love%20playfully%20and%20support.md)

* **Show love openly:** Tell your children you love them, and express affection with hugs and kisses throughout their lives.
* **Encourage and compliment:** Focus on your children's strengths, praising their efforts to build self-confidence and strengthen your bond.
* **Share laughter and joy:** Bond through play and laughter, avoiding jokes or nicknames that might hurt their feelings.
* **Spend quality time:** Engage in activities everyone enjoys, aiming to be loving 80% of the time and only strict when necessary (20%). This balance helps kindness become the norm and strictness the exception.

## [Setting Boundaries and Discipline](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Advice%20and%20admonishment.md)

* **Set clear boundaries:** Ensure children understand expectations and consequences before enforcing discipline.
* **Maintain affection in discipline:** Show affection even during discipline, like a comforting touch or hug afterward.
* **Seek Allah's forgiveness first:** Teach children that seeking forgiveness from Allah is more important than from you. Consequently, [mistakes that don't involve sinfulness should be overlooked](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Overlook%20what%20is%20disliked.md).
* [**Avoid hasty punishments:**](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Investigate%20suspicious%20matters.md) Give children the benefit of the doubt and discipline only if you're certain they acted deliberately.
* **Use meaningful consequences:** Choose non-physical punishments that express displeasure while fostering a learning moment.
* **Reinforce positive behavior:** Try a point system to encourage good behavior, possibly with friendly sibling competition.
* **Avoid public shaming:** Discuss issues privately unless using an example for others.
* **Separate action from identity:** Address the behavior as wrong, not the child, to reinforce your love for them.

## Building Faith, [Teaching, and Nurturing](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Teach%20and%20nurture.md) Talents

* **Teach about Allah's love and mercy:** Emphasize worship out of love, not fear. Help children connect with Allah through stories from the Quran.
* **Explain Islamic principles:** Teach the meaning behind practices, not just rules, so children understand why some actions are halal or haram.
* **Instill accountability:** Introduce the concept of life after death and responsibility for actions.
* **Encourage responsibility and decision-making:** Give age-appropriate chores and involve children in decisions to foster independence.
* **Avoid overprotection:** Allow children to make mistakes and learn on their own.
* **Teach financial literacy and Quranic knowledge:** Equip children with life skills and ensure they learn the Quran.
* **Adapt to the times:** Prepare children for the challenges of their generation, not just how you were raised.
* **Be a role model:** Show honesty, kindness, and respect for elders, including your own parents. Avoid showing faults and correct mistakes openly.
* **Communicate respectfully:** Use polite language and full sentences, as children mimic how you speak.
