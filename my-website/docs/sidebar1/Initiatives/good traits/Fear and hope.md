The Prophet said, "Allah says: By My Honour and Majesty, I will not combine two fears or two forms of safety for My servant. If he feels secure from Me in this world, I will make him fear Me on the Day of Judgment. If he fears Me in this world, I will grant him safety on the Day of Judgment."

# Fear and How to Attain It

When a person truly fears Allah, they are not distracted by others. Instead, they remain vigilant (muraqaba), take account of themselves (muhasaba), strive against their soul (mujahada), and are careful with every moment, thought, word, and action. This level of self-awareness depends on the depth of one's fear, which depends on one's understanding of Allah, His attributes, and the pitfalls of the soul.

Fear arises from a true knowledge of Allah. However, [observing those who possess it or learning about their lives and actions](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Choose%20your%20mentors%20well.md) can help those who struggle to grasp this knowledge directly.

As for its benefits, fear helps to combat two detrimental states: complacency and self-righteousness.

# Fears One Should Hold

* [Fear of deeds not being accepted](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Make%20dua%20after%20worship%20for%20acceptance.md).
* Fear of being misled by receiving favors.
* Fear of wavering from steadfastness.
* Fear of a bad ending.
* Fear of death pangs.
* Fear of punishment in the grave.
* Fear of the awe of standing before Allah.
* Fear of the scrutiny of one's deeds.
* Fear of crossing the bridge (sirat).
* Fear of the hellfire and its torments.
* Fear of being barred from paradise.
* Fear of being separated from Allah (highest level).

# Shifting from Fear to Hope

## 1. The Sinner

For someone engaged in sin, [fear](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Cry%20and%20fear%20misguidance.md) (_khawf_) should drive them to repent and turn away from disobedience. This fear should awaken the sinner to the gravity of their actions and bring awareness of the consequences of sin, such as divine punishment and separation from Allah. However, excessive fear leading to despair is harmful, as it extinguishes the desire for repentance and paralyzes spiritual growth.

> True fear goes beyond an emotional reaction; it should inspire real change. Avoid superficial expressions of fear, like tears shed during Quranic recitations without any practical change.

Once a sin has been committed, [hope](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Regret%20and%20prevent%20after%20committing%20a%20sin.md) (_raja_) becomes essential, encouraging the sinner to seek Allah's mercy sincerely. This shift reflects the vastness of Allah's forgiveness, allowing even severe sinners to find redemption through genuine repentance and change.

> Hope differs from wishful thinking; true hope requires effort. Just as a farmer plants and cares for a seed, expecting a harvest, a hopeful person continually takes steps to improve, regularly [reviewing their actions](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Review%20initiatives%20and%20processes.md) to ensure consistency in their effort.

## 2. The Obedient Person

For those steadfast in obedience, a balance between fear and hope is crucial. This prevents reckless overconfidence in Allah's mercy and paralyzing fear of His punishment. Umar ibn al-Khattab's saying reflects this balance; he expressed both fear of being the only one excluded from Paradise and hope of being the only one saved from Hellfire, fostering vigilance and a commitment to seeking Allah's pleasure.

## 3. Nearing Death

As death approaches, hope should be the dominant emotion, coupled with a firm belief in Allah's mercy and a positive view of His judgment. Overwhelming fear at this stage may cause distress. Instead, focusing on Allah's compassion brings peace and reassures the soul before meeting the Creator.
