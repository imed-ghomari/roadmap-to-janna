## The Reality of Gratitude

We must thank Allah in every condition. To do that, we must understand three pillars: knowledge, state, and action.

### 1. Knowledge

Knowledge is the foundation of gratitude, leading to a state of gratitude that inspires action. This includes:

* Recognizing the blessing and the One who gives it, knowing that all blessings come solely from Allah.
* Realizing that belief in others as sources of blessings weakens one's gratitude.
* For example, in a supplication, Musa asked, "My God! You created Adam with Your Hand. How did he thank you?" Allah replied, "He knew it was from Me, and that realization was gratitude."

### 2. State

The second pillar is the state of gratitude arising from knowledge. This includes feeling happiness toward the Bestower (Allah) with reverence. For instance:

* If a king gifts someone a horse, they might rejoice for its utility, for the king's favor, or because it enables them to serve the king.
* Perfect gratitude arises not from the blessing itself, but from seeing it as a means to connect with Allah, enabling righteous deeds.

### 3. Action

Gratitude is expressed through action in three ways:

* **Gratitude of the Heart**: Wishing well for others by [supplicating for them](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Supplicate%20for%20other%20people%20alive%20or%20dead.md).
* **Gratitude of the Tongue**:
	* Gratitude to Allah:
		* [Hamd and thanking Allah](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Hamd%20and%20thanking%20allah.md)
		* [Daily supplications](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Say%20morning,%20evening%20and%20before%20sleeping%20supplications.md)
		* [Chukr prayer](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Pray%20chukr%20nafil%20prayer.md)
		* [Proper attitude in hardship](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Attitude%20in%20affliction.md)
		* [Gratitude journalling](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Gratitude%20journalling.md)
	* Gratitude to the Prophet: [Sending salawat on the prophet](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Sending%20salawat%20on%20the%20prophet.md)
	* Gratitude to people: [Thank others](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Thank%20people.md)
* **Gratitude of the Limbs**: Avoiding misuse of blessings by:
	* avoiding waste
	* Using them for good, like being grateful for the blessing of the [time of ease](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Build%20knowledge%20in%20free%20time.md) by preparing for future tests. Another example would be [managing what your eyes and ears are exposed to](docs/sidebar1/Processes/Guarding%20your%20eyes%20and%20ears.md), purifying your heart, and using them for worship, such as reading His Book, reflecting on creation, and covering others' faults.

* Above all, the greatest blessing is closeness to Allah, a gift cherished because it's not subject to judgment on the Day of Judgment, contrary to other gifts.
* According to the prophet, health, youth, and free time are the most commonly wasted gifts.

## The Limits of Gratitude

Perfect gratitude is possible only for one whose heart Allah has illuminated, enabling them to see wisdom and what is beloved to Allah in all things. For those who have not attained this, following the Sunnah and Sacred Law provides the secrets of gratitude. Complete gratitude belongs to those who are sincere in standing for Allah alone.

:::info Chukr vs Hamd

I've found two different interpretations of the difference:

* Hamd is gratitude through the tongue, while Chukr is through actions.
* Hamd is a blend of Chukr and praise (madh).
