To uphold the rights of Muslim neighbors, it is essential to:

* Refrain from causing harm and avoid lengthy conversations.
* Overlook their faults and cover up their shortcomings.
* Initiate good, greet them first, and be gentle.
* Visit during illness, provide comfort during affliction and assist their families in their absence.
* Congratulate them on happy occasions.
* Respect their privacy by not disturbing shared walls, drains, or courtyards. Avoid prying into their affairs, eavesdropping on conversations, and lowering your gaze towards their women.
