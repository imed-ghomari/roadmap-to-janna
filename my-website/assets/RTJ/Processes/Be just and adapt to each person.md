	* Avoid comparing children
	* Avoid favoritism and be just in distributing gifts, attention, discipline, and privileges among your children. For example, spend time with all equally.
	* Recognize individual differences: Each child has a unique personality and will respond differently to your parenting style.
	* Don't label them with past characteristics, judge fairly, and don't do it when angry; wait until you're calm.

Major injustices include:

* Taking orphans' property
