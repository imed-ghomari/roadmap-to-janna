* Link to [Anger](Initiatives/bad%20traits/Anger.md):
	* Exercise forbearance, allowing people to correct their ways or ask forgiveness if you are wrong.
	* Forgive those who trespass against you, seeking Allah's forgiveness in return. Apply the same habit as our predecessors (let go of any resentment against other Muslims before going to sleep)
* Link to [Love of status and ostentation](Initiatives/bad%20traits/Love%20of%20status%20and%20ostentation.md): Don't get angry when accused or censored because he has informed you of your errors and bad traits. Even if he is wrong, he has reminded you of your other bad deeds and is expiating your sins.
* Link to [Following the sunnah](Initiatives/worship/Following%20the%20sunnah.md): Emulate the Prophet Muhammad's example of mercy and non-retaliation.
* Link to [Remembering death](Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md): Forgive the ones who wronged you because Allah has taken it upon himself to reward you on the day of judgment.
* Link to [Managing spouse](Initiatives/worship/Managing%20spouse.md): endure the other's harm by showing clemency/forbearance (hilm) through:
	* Not accusing the other of being the one at fault.
	* And forgetting: not holding grudges and letting go of the past by not reminding the spouse about it.
