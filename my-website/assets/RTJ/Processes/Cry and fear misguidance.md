* [Fear and Hope](Initiatives/good%20traits/Fear%20and%20hope.md):
	* **For the sinner:**
		* Before committing a sin, avoid having hope of forgiveness. Instead, cultivate fear of punishment to prevent sin. Read related verses and ahadith to reflect on the unseen consequences of sins and take the necessary precautions to protect yourself.
		* Remember the link between good and bad deeds and how each one will work against the other on the scales.
	* **For the obedient:** Strive to find a balance between fear and hope. Achieve this by considering the verses from the Quran about both the obedient and the disobedient as applying to you.
* [Remembering Death](Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md): Be like the person who remembers God in private, leading their eyes to flow with tears, to be among those under God's shade on the Day of Qiyama.
* [Repentance](Initiatives/good%20traits/Repentance.md): Remember past sins and regret them by fearing their consequences.
