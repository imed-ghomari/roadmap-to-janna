* Link to [Patience](Initiatives/good%20traits/Patience.md): Be patient with adversities outside your control (e.g., death, injury, illness, or property loss). Whether it's punishment or a trial (bala'), we can cry and feel sadness, but we should remain silent or say, *"To Allah we belong, and to Him we shall return."* Avoid complaining to others about your adversities and ensure your first reaction to calamity aligns with faith and acceptance.
* Link to [Gratitude](Initiatives/good%20traits/Gratitude.md): Be grateful even in affliction. Recognize that it could have been more severe. It is not a test in your religion. It alleviates punishment in the hereafter, and it carries wisdom and goodness for us through Allah's attribute *Al-Latif* (The Subtle and Kind).
* Link to [Contentment with Divine Decree](Initiatives/good%20traits/Contentment%20with%20divine%20decree.md):
	* Do not complain about what you cannot control. Instead, embrace contentment and trust that Allah's creation and decree always contain more good than harm.
	* Avoid excessive love for anything outside of Allah's decrees and avoid attachments to specific lifestyles.
* Link to [Anger](Initiatives/bad%20traits/Anger.md): When things don't go as you wish, say *"La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah"* (There is no power nor strength except with Allah), seek refuge (isti3atha) in Allah, and avoid letting anger control you.
* Link to [Remembrance of Allah](Initiatives/worship/Remembrance%20of%20allah.md): When you need to complain, direct your complaints to Allah. Speak to Him about your worries and ask for relief and comfort.
* Link to [Asceticism](Initiatives/good%20traits/Asceticism.md): Stay detached from states of poverty or richness, as both can distract you from Allah. Maintain a focus on spiritual connection rather than material circumstances.
* Link to [Repentance](Initiatives/good%20traits/Repentance.md): Consider the possibility that afflictions may stem from your own sins and seek repentance from Allah for guidance and forgiveness.
