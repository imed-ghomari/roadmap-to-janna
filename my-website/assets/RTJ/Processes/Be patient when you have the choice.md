Link to [Patience](Initiatives/good%20traits/Patience.md): Respond well when patience is within your control. These include:

* **Responding calmly** to provocations or frustrations.
* **Choosing honesty and restraint** in ethical dilemmas.
* **Accepting setbacks** with composure.
* **Taking time to make thoughtful decisions** in uncertain situations.

> A good rule of thumb: Be slow in reacting to worldly things but quick in competing for good deeds (to make the distinction, observe the intention of the action).
