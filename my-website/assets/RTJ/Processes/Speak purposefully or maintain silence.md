* Link to [Loquaciousness](Initiatives/bad%20traits/Loquaciousness.md): Avoid unnecessary talk, speaking about what doesn't concern you, and excessive talking. Engage in dhikr (remembrance of Allah through recitation of tasbih, tahlil, and takbir). Maintain silence except when speaking to command good, give charity, or promote reconciliation.
* Link to [Following the Sunnah](Initiatives/worship/Following%20the%20sunnah.md): The Prophet (peace be upon him) preferred long periods of silence and spoke little, and when he did, his speech was clear and eloquent.
* Link to [Remembrance of Allah](Initiatives/worship/Remembrance%20of%20allah.md):
	* Say silent dhikr (e.g., *La ilaha illallah*–there is no god but Allah) when you are not actively speaking.
	* Recite dhikr at the end of gatherings to expiate potential sins committed during the meeting. سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَّا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وأَتُوْبُ إِلَيْكَ
* Link to [Love of Status and Ostentation](Initiatives/bad%20traits/Love%20of%20status%20and%20ostentation.md): Avoid discussing your opinion unnecessarily to prevent showing off knowledge or seeking fame.

> 
> Engage in dhikr to avoid harmful conversations. If the conversation is neutral, avoid talking about others or yourself. Instead, make your point succinctly, maintain silence, avoid excessive small talk, and redirect the discussion to something more meaningful.
