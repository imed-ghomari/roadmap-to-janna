* Give in secret, concealing your good deeds just as you would your shortcomings. Let your left hand not know what your right hand gives. This shields you from showing off and protects the recipient from feeling exposed or embarrassed. Furthermore, never remind those you've helped of your generosity.
* Donate the best of what you have or love, whether it's your time, possessions, or knowledge. Remember to be generous, for Allah is the most generous. And put the needs of others before your own when they conflict.
* Choose recipients who possess as many of the following qualities as possible (prioritize giving to family members):
	* Scholars
	* Pious individuals
	* Those in physical pain
	* Families in need
	* Anonymous individuals who ask for little
	* Those who express gratitude for charity
	* Close relatives
* Be joyful in giving and let go of worldly attachments; remember that your true wealth lies in your good deeds.
* Give even if you have little; Allah will multiply your donation if it is given with sincerity.
* Make sure not to remind the recipient of what you did to him, lest you remove the reward of the charity by this action.

> Give in charity when you're healthy and greedy, as it's the best time for rewards. However, true reliance is needed during these tough times.
