* Link to [Reciting the Quran](Initiatives/worship/Engaging%20with%20the%20quran.md):
	* **Learning**: The easiest way to learn is to listen to the portion you want to memorize daily until you can recite 90% of it. Then, fill your learning gaps by using Quran applications that hide the verses when you recite. You probably will encounter two types of mistakes:
		* The first type is to stop/forget/add a word; you need to build more anchors to remember better (visually, by listening, or by understanding these verses' tafsir).
		* The second type is to replace a word with another. Here are [some ways to deal with the mutashabihat](https://howtomemorisethequran.com/25-techniques-to-memorise-mutashabihat/).
	* **Understanding**: There are various types of tafsirs, such as verse-by-verse, page-by-page, or thematic introductions to each surah. Choose the one that suits you best, or combine multiple types to enhance your understanding.
	* **Reviewing**: Use this [Anki deck](https://github.com/Nasr-905/Qurankie) to review the verses you have memorized daily. If you are unfamiliar with Anki, visit their [website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to learn more.
* Link to [Remembering Death](Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md):
	* Learn Surat Al-Kahf (either the first 10 or last 10 verses, though the whole surah is preferred) to prepare for the Antichrist (Masih ad-Dajjal).
	* Elevate your rank in paradise by learning as much as you can.
