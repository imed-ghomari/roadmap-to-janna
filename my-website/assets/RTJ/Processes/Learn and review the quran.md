* Link to [Reciting the Quran](Initiatives/worship/Reciting%20the%20quran.md):
    * **Learning**: The easiest way to learn is to listen to the portion you want to memorize daily until you can recite 90% of it. Then, focus on learning the first part of each verse (ayah) to fill in the gaps.
    * **Understanding**: There are various types of tafsirs, such as verse-by-verse, page-by-page, or thematic introductions to each surah. Choose the one that suits you best, or combine multiple types to enhance your understanding.
    * **Reviewing**: Use this [Anki deck](https://github.com/Nasr-905/Qurankie) to review the verses you have memorized daily. If you are unfamiliar with Anki, visit their [website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to learn more.
* Link to [Remembering Death](Initiatives/good%20traits/Remembering%20death.md):
    * Learn Surat Al-Kahf (either the first 10 or last 10 verses, though the whole surah is preferred) to prepare for the Masih ad-Dajjal.
    * Elevate your rank in paradise by learning as much as you can.
