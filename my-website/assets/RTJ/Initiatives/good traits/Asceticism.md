## The Fruit of Asceticism

The Prophet (PBUH) said: "Whoever wakes up with the world as his aspiration, Allah scatters his affairs, divides his wealth, and places his poverty before his eyes. He gets only what was written for him. But whoever wakes up with the afterlife as his aspiration, Allah gathers his affairs, preserves his wealth, and grants him the world despite itself."

Asceticism leads to contentment with what is necessary for life's journey—shelter, clothing, food, and furnishings—while avoiding excess. The foundation of asceticism is realization, which cultivates a withdrawal from worldly distractions. This leads to [abstinence from all but what is essential for the journey](Processes/Avoid%20indulging%20on%20the%20lawful.md).

### Food

* Eat in moderation, only to satisfy hunger, and avoid overeating.
* Prefer simple foods like barley bread over luxurious options.
* Limit condiments, opting for basic ones like vinegar, herbs, or salt.
* Reduce meat consumption to once or twice a week.

### Clothing

* Focus on basic clothing for protection, not beautification.
* Choose simple, functional attire (e.g., a shirt, pants, and scarf).
* Ideally, own just one set of clothing.

### Shelter

* Accept basic shelter, like a corner in a mosque or hospice, as the most ascetic option.
* A small private apartment is acceptable, but luxury should be avoided.
* Refrain from building extravagant dwellings.

### Furnishing the House

* Keep furnishings minimal and functional.
* Use basic, sturdy items for their purpose.
* Strive to use one item for multiple functions.
* Own only essential items, such as a comb or bowl.

## Levels of Asceticism

### General Levels

* The first level is abstinence, though the ego still desires the world, requiring effort to resist it.
* The second level is when the ego naturally turns away from the world, recognizing the impossibility of combining worldly pleasures with the afterlife.
* The third level is when the ego is indifferent to the world's existence or absence.

### Levels Based on Motivation

* The first level is asceticism driven by fear of Hell, the "asceticism of the fearful."
* The second level is motivated by longing for the pleasures of the afterlife, which is higher than fear.
* The highest level is motivated by a desire to transcend attachment to anything other than Allah, purifying the self and looking down on anything besides Him.

### Levels Based on What is Abstained From

* The highest form of asceticism is renouncing all things, both worldly and spiritual, that distract from Allah.
* A lower form of asceticism involves focusing on abstaining from worldly pleasures, such as wealth, [status](Processes/Hide%20your%20good%20deeds.md), and comfort.
* An even lower level is abstaining from wealth but still clinging to status or other worldly desires. This is a weaker form of asceticism, as status is often more desirable than wealth.

## Poverty vs. Abundance

**Asceticism** is a conscious choice to renounce worldly possessions, while **poverty** is a state of being deprived of them involuntarily. Despite its lack of choice, poverty can be seen as a virtue, protecting one from the distractions of wealth. Those who are poor are less likely to be ensnared by worldly temptations, making them more focused on the afterlife. The Prophet (PBUH) said, "The poor of my community will enter Paradise 500 years before the rich," and, "The best of this community are its poor." Furthermore, Musa (alayhis-salam) learned from Allah that "Every poor person is among His loved ones." This shows that poverty, when accepted with contentment, holds a special status with Allah.

However, wealth can be virtuous if used righteously, as the Prophet (PBUH) said, "How excellent is the useful wealth of a righteous man!" He also stated, "The strong believer is better than the weak believer."

The poor must maintain a [righteous character in the face of hardship](Processes/Attitude%20in%20affliction.md). They should avoid resentment, excessive complaints, and [begging](Processes/Don't%20ask%20for%20help%20or%20money.md). Instead, they should cultivate contentment, trust in Allah's provision, and dignity in their circumstances. Whether rich or poor, it is essential to disconnect from the state of wealth—both can become distractions unless combined with contentment and gratitude.

## The Reality of the World

The world offers various things that humans seek: shelter and agriculture from the Earth; plants for nourishment and medicine; minerals for tools and currency; animals for food and transportation; and people for relationships and work. However, these desires can lead to negative internal traits such as pride, envy, seeking reputation, and love of the world. These feelings, along with external pursuits, can distract people from their true purpose, causing them to forget their origins and ultimate end.

This attachment to worldly things is the root of all sin. The world was created to provide for the journey to the afterlife, but its distractions—comfort, status, and pleasure—cause people to lose sight of their purpose. They become like a pilgrim in the desert, preoccupied with preparing for their journey but ultimately losing their way, missing their destination, and falling victim to their surroundings.

In essence, the world is a temporary station for those traveling toward Allah. It's like a rest stop along the road where travelers gather supplies for the journey. Those who focus only on what is necessary—food, clothing, and basic needs—are preparing well for the afterlife. But those who become absorbed in worldly pleasures are destined for loss.

The world is like a ship that stops at an island. The captain warns the passengers of the dangers and urges them to return quickly, but some of them are distracted and fail to return in time. Those who understand the true nature of the world—who know themselves, their Lord, and the afterlife—see the world's distractions for what they are. True happiness in the afterlife comes only through knowing and loving Allah. This requires constant remembrance and seeking knowledge, which cannot be achieved unless one turns away from the distractions of the material world.

The world, like a temporary home, should not be clung to. It is for those who are traveling, who benefit from it without attachment, leaving it behind for those who will come after them. This is the true understanding of the world and its purpose.

## Signs of Renunciation

* You don't feel pleasure in possessions, nor sorrow for lacking them.
* You are not happy with praise or recognition.
* You work without attachment, speak without greed, and seek honor without seeking power.

## Maintaining Balance

True balance means engaging with the world without losing sight of your ultimate goal—pleasing Allah and preparing for the afterlife.

* **[Clean and beautify yourself](Processes/Clean%20and%20beautify%20yourself.md):** Take care of your body with respect and gratitude, but avoid vanity or attachment to superficial beauty.
* **[Take breaks to recharge](Processes/Take%20breaks%20to%20recharge.md):** Rest when needed, but ensure your breaks don't become distractions. Use them to reflect and reconnect with your purpose.
* **Worldly happiness as a means:** A good spouse, neighbor, home, and transportation are blessings that provide happiness, but they should be used to support your journey to Allah, not as ends in themselves.
