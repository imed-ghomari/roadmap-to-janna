The Prophet said: "I have left two guides among you: one is silent, and one speaks. The silent one is death, and the one that speaks is the Qur'an." Once, a man asked, "O Messenger of Allah! Who is the smartest and noblest among people?" He replied, "The one who remembers death the most and prepares earnestly for it. These are the wisest; they achieve both worldly honor and eternal nobility."

## Benefits and Approach to Remembering Death

1. **Benefits**: Reflecting on death encourages detachment from worldly things and longing for the hereafter. Those who truly love God will yearn to meet Him.
2. **Method**: To reflect on death:
    * Set aside time alone, empty your mind of other thoughts, and deeply contemplate.
    * Remember those who have passed—friends and peers who once held ambitions, wealth, and status. Reflect on their last moments, regrets, and physical decay.
    * Remind yourself that, like them, your body will weaken, and your life will end similarly.
    * [Visit graveyards](Processes/Visit%20the%20dead.md) and [make prayers for the deceased](Processes/Supplicate%20for%20other%20people%20alive%20or%20dead.md)

## Vain Hopes and Heedlessness of Death

Heedlessness stems from vain hopes, which breed laziness and procrastination. The Prophet warned, "The most frightening traits I fear for my community are following desires and vain hopes." To combat this:

* Focus on short-term goals, remembering death each morning and evening when reciting [daily supplications](Processes/Say%20morning,%20evening%20and%20before%20sleeping%20supplications.md).
* Avoid [excessive planning and saving](Processes/Small%20hopes%20when%20planning%20and%20saving.md) without purpose.

## The Reality of Death

The "perfect gnostic" is someone so immersed in the remembrance of Allah that they have no fear or need to dwell on death. To them, death is simply a transition to further clarity, not an end.

The reality of death relates to the reality of life and the spirit. Our spirit remains after death, experiencing either joy or sorrow. It does not die; instead, it is freed from the body, with death seen as a believer's gift.

Death is the complete cessation of bodily functions, leading to absolute physical deterioration. In the afterlife, three types of punishment may occur:

1. **Loss of Desired Things**: Similar to a viper's painful bite, it represents separation from worldly attachments.
2. **Humiliation**: Actions once perceived as good may be revealed as shameful.
3. **Regret for Lost Opportunities**: Like being in darkness, realizing the true nature of one's actions too late.

## Prepare for the Day of Judgement

Abii Zakariya al-Taymi said: *"Once when Sulayman Ibn 'Abdu'lMalik was in the Sacred Masjid, a stone with an inscription was brought to him. He sought someone to read it, and upon it was written: 'O son of Adam! If you were to see how close you are to the end of your life, you would renounce your long hopes, seek to increase your good deeds and shorten your ambitions. Regret comes only when you slip (through sin) and are separated from your family. Then, it becomes clear that you will not return to the world nor increase your good deeds. So, act for the Day of Judgement, the day of grief and regret.'"*
