## The Nature of Anger

* Anger is a serious issue because its outward manifestations include violence, cursing, and insulting. At the same time, inwardly, it involves hatred, envy, harboring ill will, profanity, the intention to expose another's secrets, joy at the suffering of others, and sadness when others are happy. Each of these characteristics is destructive on its own!
* The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Through forbearance, a person will attain the same level of reward as someone who stands in prayer at night and fasts during the day and will be considered mighty despite having control only over their household." He also said, "The strong person is not the one who overcomes others by strength, but **the one who controls themselves while in anger**." And lastly, "May Allah have mercy upon a person who is [easy-going when they sell](Processes/Have%20mercy%20in%20business%20dealings.md), buy, and ask for payment."

## Classes of Man in Terms of Anger

1. Some men get angry suddenly and are quickly appeased.
2. Some get angry late, lasting a long time.
3. Some get angry late, and their anger ceases quickly. This is the best.
4. Some get angry quickly, lasting a long time. This is the worst.

## Breaking Anger and Containing It When Agitated

To deal with anger, you must do two things:

* **Breaking it by practice**:
	* Breaking anger doesn't mean removing it entirely, as its basis cannot be eliminated and should not be. It is essential for [fighting against wrongdoing and establishing good](Processes/Hate%20the%20disobedient%20and%20love%20the%20obedient.md).
	* This is achieved through perseverance until you become accustomed to patience and forbearance in anger-provoking situations. For example, [accepting accusations or forgiving transgressions against you](Processes/Accept%20accusations%20or%20forgive%20transgressions%20against%20you.md).
* **Containing it when provoked**: This involves knowledge and practice.
	* Knowledge: Understand that there's no reason for anger except for not accepting that things happen according to Allah's Will, not our own. Remember that Allah's Anger is greater than our own, but His Grace is even greater. Reflect on your disobedience to Allah and consider why you should become angry when someone opposes you. Obedience to Allah's Command should be the priority. This is exemplified by approaching challenges with the [right attitude](Processes/Attitude%20in%20affliction.md) and [being forbearant, kind, and gentle whenever possible](Processes/Managing%20difference%20of%20opinion.md).
	* Practice: Say, "I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the Accursed," knowing that anger is from Satan. If it persists, [change your position](Processes/Stay%20silent%20and%20change%20position%20in%20anger.md)â€”sit down if you are standing or lie down if you are sitting. If it still doesn't lessen, perform ablution.
