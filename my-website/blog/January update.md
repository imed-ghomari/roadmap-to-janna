## Changes

* Added more details on how to learn the Quran based on personal experience.
* Changed the vault links to include a "repeat icon" for recurring processes, enhancing visualization.
* I added a mention of "waiting" initiatives and processes, which were overlooked in both scripts in the performance section.
* The last section of "Choose Your Mentors Well" provides additional ways to benefit from predecessors' stories.
* Revised "How to Manage Desires of the Private Parts" to reflect Ghazali's opinion on this topic better.
* Renamed the "Reciting the Quran" initiative to "Engaging with the Quran" to eliminate confusion with a similarly titled process.
* Added links to the Family Support process within the "Upholding the Rights of Muslims" initiative.
* Included a link to the Seeking the Lawful initiative in the Patience initiative regarding acts of disobedience.
* Mentioned "Inshallah" in the Reliance initiative.
* Added more details on balancing fear and hope in the "Cry and Fear Misguidance" process.
* Included a link to the "Speak Purposefully" process through the "Managing Differences of Opinion" table.
* Merged "Love" and "Contentment with Divine Decree" into the "Love and Contentment" initiative since contentment is a sign of love, and they are too closely related to remain separate.
* The weekly review section "Actions Done All the Time" was changed to follow the "Hope-Fear-Love" Taqwa model.
* Updated specific properties in the downloadable vault to align with the merged initiatives and improve the accuracy of the performance graphs.
* Highlighted the need to take precautions in the “fear of misguidance” process, as it constitutes the resulting action of fear.

## Deletions
