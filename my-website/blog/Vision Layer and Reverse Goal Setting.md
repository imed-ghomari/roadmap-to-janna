## Additions

* Introduced the "Vision" layer to the top of the hierarchy to explicitly state the ultimate goal (Janna) that drives all subsequent actions.
* Adopted a "Reverse Goal Setting" framework to better align the system with spiritual aspirations rather than corporate productivity metrics.

## Changes

* **System Overhaul**: Transitioned from the OKR (Objectives, Key Results, Initiatives) framework to a Vision-based structure (Vision, Objectives, Domains).
    * **Objectives** now refer to the high-level milestones (previously Key Results).
    * **Domains** now refer to the specific areas of responsibility (previously Initiatives).
* Updated the "Getting Started" and "Obsidian Implementation" guides to reflect the new terminology and structure.
* Renamed the `Initiatives` folder to `Objective` to match the new hierarchy.
* Added link in stinginess domain to the spending process

## Deletions

* Removed OKR-specific terminology (Key Results, Initiatives) to simplify the mental model and reduce corporate jargon.
