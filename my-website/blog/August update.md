## Changes

* Better explained the reason behind "false hope of pardon" in the "Overcoming the Habit of Sin" section.
* Clarified how to expiate sins in the "regret and prevent after committing a sin" process.
* Slightly clarified the initiative of "anger."
* Clarified the benefits of repentance.
* Emphasized the traveler's philosophy in the asceticism initiative.
* Highlighted the connection between commanding good verbally and through actions.
* Restructured the section on gratitude to differentiate between feeling grateful and actually being grateful.
* Renamed the process "pride and lesser blessings" to "don't be deluded by fame, wealth, lineage, or beauty" to remove ambiguity.
* Linked the "regret" part of repentance to the fear before the sin to clarify when each state should be practiced.

## Deletions

* Removed the process "pride and better blessings" and combined it with "don't consider yourself pious or more pious than anyone" because they essentially describe the same action.
